<h1>The Best Movies According to Cryo</h1>
<h2>My Top-3 Movies of all-time <s>or at least that I recall while working on this project</s></h2>
<hr />
<h3>Treasure Planet</h3>
<p>Favourite animation movie since I was little, love the art, the soundtrack and of course the story, I mean, it is space+pirates and a lovely father-son relationship, who wouldn't love it.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>My favourite movie overall I think, it has wonderful art, mesmerizing soundtracks, space, huge waves, a lovely father-daughter relationship... wait a sec, I'm seeing a pattern here...</p>
<h3>The Bicentennial Man</h3>
<p>This time there are no pirates or space, but just the majestic Robbie Williams in one of the movies that are sure to make me cry at the end.</p>
